(Put your a brief description of your final interactive visualization application and your dataset here.)

## Running Instructions

Live here: http://example.com

#### Run Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# To use global command `gulp`
npm install -g gulp
```

#### Running in the browser
Runs an initial build, listens on your files changes, rebuilds them when necessary
and automagically reloads the browser!

```bash
gulp watch
```

Put your running instructions here. (Tell us how to run your visualization.)

If your visualization is web-based,  it would be great if your submission can be opened online. [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) is a good and easy way to put your visualization online so you can put your link here.  For example:

Access our visualization at http://cse512-16s.github.io/a3-jheer-mcorrell-jhoffs/ or download this repository and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000` and access this from http://localhost:9000/.

If you put your work online, please also write a [one-line description and add a link to your final work](http://note.io/1n3u46s) so people can access it directly from the CSE512-16S page.

## Story Board

Put either your storyboard content or a [link to your storyboard pdf file](storyboard.pdf?raw=true) here. Just like A2, you can use any software to create a *reasonable* pdf storyboard.

### Changes between Storyboard and the Final Implementation

A paragraph explaining changes between the storyboard and the final implementation.
